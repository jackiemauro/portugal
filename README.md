# portugal
Contains R code that should develop into an R package. 
It should be able to take an input set of formulae and either simulate or use data, then run it through the likelihood functions found before. This procedure should be relatively flexible, able to specify which endogenous and exogenous variables are used in what way and able to deal with multiple endogenous, exogenous and instrumental variables.

To do:
Cragg version
Incorporate a rho option
Cholesky decomposition
Fully test and verify
Make into a package
